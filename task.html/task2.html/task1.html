       <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
<li>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>
<li>It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.

    The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
</p>
<center><img src="HTML-Basic-Format-768x534.png" alt=""></center>
<li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-doctypes/">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</a>-This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/">&lt;html&gt;</a>-This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-head-tag/">&lt;head&gt;</a>-The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front end of a webpage. Typical elements inside the <head> include:</li>
    <ul type="circle">
    <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/">&lt;tittle&gt;</a>-Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.</li>

    </ul>
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/">&lt;tittle&gt;</a>-The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing.</li>
<li>The tag is a second-level heading tag.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-p-tag/">&lt;p&gt;</a>-The tag represents a paragraph of text.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-body-tag/">&lt;body&gt;</a>-The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li>
